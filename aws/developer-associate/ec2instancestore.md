- EBS are n/w drives with limited performance
- These a high performace h/w disks, use EC2 Instance Store
- better I/O performance
- Loose	their storage if they are stopped (ephemeral)
- Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temp content
- Risk of data loss if h/w fails
- backups and replication are your responsibility
